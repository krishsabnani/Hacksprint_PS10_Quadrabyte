# Problem Statement:
PS
PS10 - Expense Tracker application which will keep a track of Income-Expense of a user on a day to day basis. This application takes Income from user and divides in daily expense allowed. If u exceed that days expense it will cut if from your income and give new daily expense allowed amount, and if that days expense is less it will add it in savings. Expense tracking application will generate report at the end of month to show Income-Expense via multiple graphs. It will also let you add the savings amount which you
had saved for some particular Festivals or day like Birthday or Anniversary.

# Day 1

On the first day, the workflow was divided into two major parts, and primarily revolved around the UI and Back-end with Integration.
The basic structure of the application was designed along with the implementation of an opening screen and login/register elements.
Mentoring Session
During the first mentoring session we were advised to invest greater time towards the application framework and UI elements.
We were also advised to add extra functionalities, mainly the addition a "Download Report" element.
Redundancies were also mentioned for the sake of better time distribution and workflow.
# Screenshots

To ensure streamlined access and visiblility of the presentation, screenshots have been added as google drive links.

# Day 2
The second day revolved around increasing the functionality of the application.
Extra focus was given towards Expense Addition, Report Generation and integration of a calendar for the user's convenience.
Along with that, much needed back-end integration to enable the functionality of individual elements was achieved.
Post mentoring session, we started working on documentation and showcase video.
Mentoring Session
During the second mentoring session, emphasis was given towards improving UI elements and responsiveness of the application.
We were also informed about the importance of immaculate documentation required for the evaluation.
A suggestion was made towards making a showcase video for the same.

As mentioned in the slide for day 1, similar format has been followed for day 2 screenshots.

# Day 3
After two days of continuous commits on the next-release branch, it was finally merged with master branch.
Final touches were made to the documentation as well as the showcase video.
Hurdles Faced
Hurdles faced
We had an extra functionality proposed to utilize user data to predict spending habits and trends, using Machine Learning Models.
However, due to time constraints as well prioritizing points mentioned on the problem statements this remained an unachieved goal.
Moving along, due to the use of different coding environments on individual machines, integration of code on GitHub was a challenge, which was later over come by establishing an ad-hoc branch (next-release) that acted as and intermediary between the individual and master branch.
We also worked extensively via screen share to mitigate aforementioned integration errors.

# Improvements & Changes
# Improvements & Solution

Initially the application consisted of varying colors and no set design was followed.
Later, the application was styled using a simple and elegant design theme which constituted of white, black & green colors.
Also, the unrouted pages were appropriately linked with the buttons so as to follow protocol and disabled the functionality of an unregistered user attempting to navigate through the application.

# Finished application:
# Demo
After 2 days of tireless coding, documenting and encountering obstacles, we were able to develop the application which checked all the pointers mentioned in the problem statement. To conclude the process, we have attached screenshots which represent the final application.
